This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
* Type 1 to enter a new car
* Type the number 2 to display the list of cars
* Type 3 to quit and exit the program

*Note: the cars will be stored in and retrieved from in My_old_cars.txt*
